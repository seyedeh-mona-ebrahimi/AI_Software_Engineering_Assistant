## 🧭 Overview
The **AI Software Engineering Assistant** helps developers, architects, and DevOps engineers stay current by:
- 🔧 Tracking new frameworks, tools, and practices
- 📚 Automatically fetching knowledge from reliable sources
- 🧠 Generating answers using real-time data, without retraining the model

It uses:
- 🔍 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- 🎯 Trust-based document ranking
- ✅ Consistency checking to ensure relevance and accuracy

Sources include:
- ArXiv, GitHub, Stack Overflow, RFCs
- Hacker News, Reddit, Dev.to, Medium
- Google Scholar, GitHub Discussions

## ⚙️ Installation Instructions

### ✅ Step 1: Set Up a Virtual Environment
```bash
conda create -n capstone_env python=3.10
conda activate capstone_env
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio
```

### ✅ Step 2: Install Required Python Libraries
```bash
pip install streamlit
pip install torch transformers peft trl accelerate chromadb faiss-cpu sentence-transformers langchain rank_bm25 -U langchain-community
pip install python-dotenv wandb ipywidgets
pip install speechrecognition pydub pillow pytesseract pyaudio
pip install beautifulsoup4 scholarly
```

### 🍏 Step 3: Special Instructions for macOS (PyAudio & Tesseract)
```bash
# Install Homebrew if not installed
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Add Homebrew to PATH
echo 'eval "$\(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv\)"' >> ~/.zprofile
eval "$\(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv\)"

# Install audio & OCR dependencies
brew install portaudio
brew install tesseract

# Then reinstall PyAudio
pip install pyaudio
```
